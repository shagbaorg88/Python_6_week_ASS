Here’s a good draft for your **Ubuntu Image Fetcher** project:

---

# 🐧 Ubuntu Image Fetcher

Welcome to the **Ubuntu Image Fetcher**!
This is a small Python tool that helps you **get pictures from the internet and save them to your computer**.

Think of it like a **photo catcher** 🎣 — you give it the links, and it brings the pictures to you.

---

## ✨ What It Does

* 🖼️ Finds pictures from the web
* 📥 Saves them into a folder called **images/**
* ✅ Works with more than one picture at a time
* 🚫 Tells you if something went wrong

---

## 🛠️ What You Need

Before you start, make sure you have:

* 🐍 **Python 3** (your computer should know how to run Python)
* 📦 **pip** (to install libraries)

You will also need to install one library:

```bash
pip install requests
```

---

## 🚀 How To Use

1. **Download the code** (this project folder).
2. Open a **terminal** or **command prompt**.
3. Run the program:

```bash
python fetcher.py
```

4. The program will:

   * Show a welcome message
   * Download the images from the internet
   * Save them inside a folder named **images/**

---

## 📂 Where Do My Pictures Go?

After running, you will see a new folder called **images/** in the same place as the script.
All your pictures will be saved there.

Example:

```
Ubuntu Image Fetcher/
│
├── fetcher.py
└── images/
    ├── ubuntu-logo32.png
    └── ubuntu-logo14.png
```

---

## 🧸 Example for Little Kids

Imagine you say:
👉 “Fetcher, please get me this picture!”
Fetcher runs to the internet 🏃‍♂️, grabs the picture 🎁, and puts it in your **images** box 📦.

Do this for many pictures, and soon you’ll have a whole **Ubuntu photo album**! 📚✨

---

## 🔒 Notes for Adults

* Uses the `requests` library for HTTP requests.
* Saves files using the filename parsed from the URL.
* Gracefully handles download errors.
* Easily extendable: just update the list of URLs in `main()`.

## 📜 License

This project is free to use.
You can change it, share it, or use it in your own projects.

👉 Would you like me to also add **step-by-step pictures/diagrams** (like a kid’s storybook) inside the README, so it’s even more child-friendly and visual?
